# Atalanta — Documentation Hub

The central index for every concept, rule, workflow, and system powering the **Atalanta** instrumental rock project.

## Core Documents

- **[CONCEPT.md](./CONCEPT.md)** — Story spine, thematic constraints, and detailed track briefs (the *why* and *what*).
- **[RULES.md](./RULES.md)** — Creative guardrails covering harmony, motifs, and instrument roles (the *guardrails*).
- **[WORKFLOW.md](./WORKFLOW.md)** — Six-phase production workflow, plus start/stop rituals (the *how*).
- **[SYSTEM.md](./SYSTEM.md)** — Logic Pro guitar pattern engine ensuring repeatable rhythm construction (the *systems toolkit*).

## How to Use This Folder

- Read `CONCEPT.md` first so every arrangement descends from the same myth and mood map.
- Keep `RULES.md` open while writing; it defines the non-negotiable musical language.
- Move through `WORKFLOW.md` step by step to keep production velocity consistent.
- Drop in to `SYSTEM.md` whenever rhythm guitars are being programmed or templated.
