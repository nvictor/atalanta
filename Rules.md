# Atalanta — Unified Creative Brief

This is the binding ruleset for the project—keep it open whenever you write, arrange, or mix so every decision points back to the same myth and emotional arc.

## 1. Purpose & Narrative Spine
- Instrumental rock concept album tracing a woman’s journey from abandonment to freedom through exile, conflict, and transcendence.
- The single-sentence framing stays pinned in view for every track decision.

## 2. Global Album Constraints
- **Key center:** every track in A minor.
- **Titles:** each track name begins with “A”; album title is fixed as *Atalanta*.
- **Mood tags:** ≤3 adjectives per track.
- **Groove:** exactly one descriptor per track.

## 3. Thematic Motifs
- **Artemis theme:** powerful calling riff anchoring “Artemis” and “Atalanta”.
- **Atalanta theme:** emotional, searching line used in “Abandoned I/II” and “Atalanta”.
- **Freedom theme:** perpetual-motion climax of “Atalanta”.

## 4. Track Execution Template
- Each track commits to: one primary riff, one secondary motif, one texture change, one emotional turn.
- A track is “done” only when structure and motifs are final and the arrangement performs start-to-finish without interruption.

## 5. Instrument Role Locks
- Clean guitar = memory/innocence.
- Distorted guitar = conflict/will.
- Rhythm guitar = motion/grounding.
- Bass = inevitability/foundation.
- Drums = environment and motion; never a chops showcase.

## 6. Melodic Language & Pitch Rules
### 6.1 Pitch Hierarchy
- **Structural tones (anchors):** 1 (A), ♭3/3 (C/B), 5 (E). Use to start/end phrases, hold or repeat at boundaries.
- **Connective tones (motion):** 2 (B), ♭7 (G), 4 (D). Keep short, avoid phrase endings, resolve quickly to an anchor.

### 6.2 Pitch Vocabulary
- Max six pitch classes per section; default set A–B–C–D–E–G.
- No new pitches for contrast—use rhythm, register, repetition instead.

### 6.3 Terraced Motion Principle
- Melodies move Hold → Step → Hold; repetition before motion.
- Stepwise motion dominates; leaps > a third are rare and immediately corrected.
- Think in plateaus rather than long arcs.

## 7. Section Behavior
- **Verse:** slower grid (≤16ths), longer holds, descending/static bias, phrases resolve to 1 or 5, minimal reusable cells. Emotion: grounding and narrative.
- **Chorus:** faster grid (≤32nds), short repeating 4–6 note cells, energy via rhythmic push—not range—conservative pitch set, deliberate repetition. Emotion: urgent, ritualistic drive.

## 8. Cell-Based Composition
- Build melodies from small reusable cells (e.g., 1 → 2 → ♭3 → hold → 4 → 1).
- Allowed variations: swap ending tone (1→5), shift octave, adjust rhythmic density.
- Disallowed: new contour shapes, big interval jumps, chromatic decoration.

## 9. Summary Directive
Anchor melodies on tonic/third/fifth, move between them with stepwise terraces, and generate momentum through rhythmic density and repetition while every track obeys the A-minor, “A” title, and one-riff/one-motif framework.
