# Rules

This is the binding ruleset for the project—keep it open whenever you write, arrange, or mix so every decision points back to the same myth and emotional arc.

## Narrative Spine
- Instrumental rock concept album tracing a woman’s journey from abandonment to freedom through exile, conflict, and transcendence.
- The single-sentence framing stays pinned in view for every track decision.

## Thematic Motifs
- **Artemis theme:** powerful calling riff anchoring “Artemis” and “Atalanta”.
- **Atalanta theme:** emotional, searching line used in “Abandoned I/II” and “Atalanta”.
- **Freedom theme:** perpetual-motion climax of “Atalanta”.

## Instrument Roles
- **Clean guitar:** Memory, innocence.
- **Distorted guitar:** Conflict, will.
- **Rhythm guitar:** Motion, grounding.
- **Bass:** Inevitability, foundation.
- **Drums:** Environment, motion.
