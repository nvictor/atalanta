# Atalanta — Execution Plan (Gemini)

**Objective:** Eliminate friction. Force progress. Complete the album.

**Global Constraints:**
1.  **Key:** All tracks are in **A Minor**.
2.  **Theme:** All tracks start with **A**.

---

## 1. The Friction-Killing Workflow

To avoid getting stuck, follow this **4-Step Cycle** for every track. Do not jump ahead.

### Phase 1: The Foundation (Structure & Drums)
*   **Goal:** A full song structure driven by EZDrummer.
*   **Tools:** EZDrummer + Scratch Guitar (optional).
*   **Rules:**
    *   Browse EZDrummer grooves to find the "pulse" of the track.
    *   Drag and drop blocks to build the entire arrangement (Intro -> Verse -> Chorus...).
    *   *Definition of Done:* The drum track is complete from start to finish. You can "hear" the song just by listening to the drums.

#### Song Parts in EZDrummer
*   **Intro**: The beginning of the song, often with a count-in.
*   **Verse**: The main narrative section of the song.
*   **Pre-Chorus**: Builds tension leading into the chorus.
*   **Chorus**: The main, most memorable part of the song, often repeated.
*   **Bridge/Solo**: A contrasting section, sometimes an interlude or solo section.
*   **Fill**: Short drum fills that transition between sections.
*   **Ending/Outro**: Concludes the song.

### Phase 2: The Core (Rhythm & Low End)
*   **Goal:** Lock in the harmonic and rhythmic bed.
*   **Tools:** EZBass + Rhythm Guitar chain.
*   **Rules:**
    *   **Drum export pass:** After Phase 1, bounce every song part (intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge/solo, fills, outro) from EZDrummer as separate MIDI clips so EZBass knows the exact groove.
    *   **Bass:** Import those clips into EZBass, audition/derive the matching bass patterns per section, and tweak articulations until the bass part locks to the printed drums.
    *   **Rhythm:** Track rhythm guitars against either the printed drums or the committed EZBass part—your choice of order—but both instruments must be finished before moving to Phase 3.
    *   *Definition of Done:* Bass + rhythm guitars play through end-to-end and feel like a solid instrumental backing track that makes you nod your head.

### Phase 3: The Voice (Melody & Lead)
*   **Goal:** The main themes and emotional delivery.
*   **Instruments:** Lead Guitar / Melody instruments.
*   **Rules:**
    *   Record the main melodies and solos.
    *   This is the *last* layer of composition.
    *   *Definition of Done:* The song has its identity and emotional peak.

### Phase 4: The Polish (Ear candy)
*   **Goal:** Transitions and dynamics.
*   **Rules:**
    *   Add FX, automation, and "ear candy".
    *   Mix.

## 2. The "Live" Tracker

Mark progress with: `[ ]` (Todo), `[/]` (In Progress), `[x]` (Done).

| Order | Track | BPM | Mood | Status | Phase |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Artemis** | 88 | Powerful, Epic | `[ ]` | 1. Foundation |
| **2** | **Atalanta** | 148 | Melancholic, Fast | `[ ]` | 1. Foundation |
| **3** | **Abandoned I** | 68 | Sad, Hopeful | `[ ]` | 1. Foundation |
| **4** | **Abandoned II** | 80 | Anger, Heavy | `[ ]` | 1. Foundation |
| **5** | **Arcadia** | 120 | Happy, Dance | `[ ]` | 1. Foundation |
| **6** | **Adventure** | 108 | Hope, Drive | `[ ]` | 1. Foundation |
| **7** | **Attack** | 144 | Chaotic | `[ ]` | 1. Foundation |
| **8** | **Artifice** | 140 | Exciting, Pop | `[ ]` | 1. Foundation |

*> **Strategy Note:** We are following the "Anchor Track" strategy. Write the main themes (Artemis, Atalanta) first to establish the musical vocabulary.*

## 3. Quick Reference (The "Don't Look Up")

**Artemis (The Anthem)**
*   **Ref:** Cranberries - Zombie / 21 Pilots - No Chances
*   **Key Idea:** The "Calling Riff" - Simple, heavy, repetitive.

**Atalanta (The Climax)**
*   **Ref:** Foo Fighters - My Hero / Buckethead
*   **Key Idea:** Running for eternity. Fast but emotional.

**Abandoned I (The Origin)**
*   **Ref:** Metallica - Nothing Else Matters
*   **Key Idea:** 6/8 ballad. Acoustic start.
