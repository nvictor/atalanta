# Concept & Tracks

## The Story

Atalanta was born a girl, not the son her father wanted. So the king abandoned her to die by the mountainside. Her cries drew out a mamma bear. Instead of killing her, she took her and raised her as one of her cubs.

The time came for the cubs to leave their mom. That's when she came. The goddess of wilderness: Artemis. She took Atalanta to Arcadia. Artemis raised Atalanta like her daughter. And the young girl became a swift huntress, a fast runner, and a great warrior.

No one, including the other gods, dared to enter Arcadia. But a man, Hippomenes, wandered there once. He was Atalanta's first contact with the outside world.

When the time came, Artemis sent her champion on a journey with the Argonauts. She warned her to never marry a man nor forget everything she had taught her. They began their adventure. On sea, on land, to great palaces and to great kingdoms. Against great warriors, against gods. The argonauts came back victorious. And she, Atalanta, came back pregnant.

Artemis would not let her set foot in Arcadia. She did not break her vow not to marry a man but she broke up with the Arcadian way of life.

Banished from Arcadia, Atalanta set home by the mountainside. Hippomenes found her once again. He brought news of her father looking for his now famous daughter.

The king organized a foot race to find Atalanta a husband. This would be her very last race.

Meanwhile, Hippomenes sought help from the goddess of love, Aphrodite. During the race, Atalanta, enticed by three golden apples, slowed down. This allowed Hippomenes to win the race.

They got married but forgot to show any gratitude to Aphrodite. So she cursed them. And in their accursed state, they provoked the wrath of Rhea, the mother of Zeus. Rhea turned Atalanta and Hippomenes into lions, compelled to run for eternity.

Atalanta was free at last. She would often stop on her track to let her goddess mother, Artemis, pet her.

### Narrative Summarized

Atalanta was abandoned by her father for being born a girl. A mother bear raised her until Artemis, goddess of the wilderness, took her to Arcadia and trained her as a huntress. Atalanta joined the Argonauts, but when she returned pregnant, Artemis banished her from Arcadia. She later reunited with Hippomenes, who won her in a foot race with the help of Aphrodite's golden apples. They married but angered the gods, leading to their transformation into lions, forever running. Despite this, Atalanta found freedom and occasional comfort from Artemis.
