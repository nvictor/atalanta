# Atalanta — Workflow & Tracker

## 1. The 6-Phase Cycle
1. **Phase 1: Foundation (Drums)** - Build the entire arrangement in EZdrummer, add section labels/fill reminders, and export MIDI so other instruments can reference/replace the kit later.
2. **Phase 2: Harmonic Bed (Chords + Bass)**
*   **Goal:** Lock the harmonic map and low end before any guitar work.
*   **Tools:** Scratch piano/guitar for chords, EZdrummer MIDI exports, EZbass.
*   **Process:**
    *   Draft a simple MIDI chord progression (or scratch guitar) that mirrors the sections from Phase 1.
    *   Import the drum MIDI into EZbass so groove references stay exact.
    *   Program bass lines in EZbass, tweaking patterns until they feel glued to the drums.
    *   Print drums + bass into Logic and confirm they flow end-to-end.
    *   *Definition of Done:* Drums, chords, and bass run top-to-bottom and feel like a cohesive backing track.
3. **Phase 3: Structure Review (Logic)** - Rehearse the EZdrummer/EZbass arrangement inside Logic, fine-tune transitions/tempo, and create marker notes describing where rhythm guitars should punch, break, or add dynamics.
4. **Phase 4: Rhythm Blueprint (MIDI)** - Duplicate the approved chord progression, trim notes to guitar registers, and sketch rhythmic motifs (downstrokes, chugs, syncopation cues) using Logic MIDI FX or a guitar strummer so the ideas stay guitar-centric.
5. **Phase 5: Rhythm Creation (Guitars)** - With the chosen DI + amp sim or guitar instrument, program/record rhythm parts using the Phase 3 notes and Phase 4 blueprint; dial palm mutes, slides, and dynamics to lock with the rhythm section.
6. **Phase 6: Integration & Freeze** - Layer rhythm guitars with drums/bass in Logic, automate tone/velocity shifts per section, and freeze/print stems so later lead or vocal sessions remain lightweight and consistent.
