# Atalanta — Workflow & Tracker

## 1. The 4-Phase Cycle
1. **Phase 1: Foundation (Drums)** - Full structure in EZdrummer.
2. **Phase 2: The Core (Harmony & Low End)**
*   **Goal:** Lock in the harmonic and rhythmic bed.
*   **Tools:** Piano/Guitar (for chords) + EZbass + Rhythm Guitar chain.
*   **Rules:**
    *   **Harmonic Map:** Before the bass, lay down a simple MIDI chord progression or scratch guitar track to define the harmony.
    *   **Drum export pass:** After Phase 1, bounce every song part from EZdrummer as separate MIDI clips so EZbass knows the exact groove.
    *   **Bass:** Import clips into EZbass, audition/derive patterns against the **Harmonic Map**, and tweak until it locks to the drums.
    *   **Rhythm:** Track final rhythm guitars against the established bed.
    *   *Definition of Done:* Chords + Bass + Rhythm guitars play through end-to-end and feel like a solid backing track.
3. **Phase 3: Voice (Lead)** - Record main melodies and solos.
4. **Phase 4: Polish (Ear Candy)** - Transitions, automation, and mixing.
