## 💡 Notes & Ideas

### Musical Themes
- **Artemis theme:** Powerful calling riff (appears in tracks 2, 8)
- **Atalanta theme:** Emotional, searching melody (tracks 1, 6, 8)
- **Freedom theme:** Running/perpetual motion (track 8)

### Production Considerations
- Track 6 needs to contrast with track 1 (both deal with abandonment but different contexts)
- Consider instrumental callbacks to earlier themes in track 8
- Tempo progression: Start slow (68) → Build energy (120-148) → End at highest tempo (148) = eternal running

### Questions to Resolve
- Should track 6 keep the "(Abandoned) Again" title or rename?
- How to musically represent pregnancy/motherhood in instrumental format?
- Should there be interludes or go straight track-to-track?

## 📝 Story Summary (Reference)

Atalanta was abandoned by her father for being born a girl. A mother bear raised her until Artemis, goddess of the wilderness, took her to Arcadia and trained her as a huntress. Atalanta joined the Argonauts, but when she returned pregnant, Artemis banished her from Arcadia. She later reunited with Hippomenes, who won her in a foot race with the help of Aphrodite's golden apples. They married but angered the gods, leading to their transformation into lions, forever running. Despite this, Atalanta found freedom and occasional comfort from Artemis.
