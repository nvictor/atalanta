## 💡 Notes & Ideas

### Global Constraints
- **Key Center:** All tracks in A Minor.
- **The Letter 'A':** A playful constraint binding the album's identity (All titles start with A).

### Musical Themes
- **Artemis theme:** Powerful calling riff (appears in tracks 2, 8)
- **Atalanta theme:** Emotional, searching melody (tracks 1, 6, 8)
- **Freedom theme:** Running/perpetual motion (track 8)

### Production Considerations
- Track 6 needs to contrast with track 1 (both deal with abandonment but different contexts)
- Consider instrumental callbacks to earlier themes in track 8
- Tempo progression: Start slow (68) → Build energy (120-148) → End at highest tempo (148) = eternal running
