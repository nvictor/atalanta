# Atalanta — Album Structure & Execution Plan (ChatGPT)

This document converts the structural recommendations into a clear, executable reference you can return to during writing sessions. Its purpose is to reduce friction, constrain decisions, and maintain narrative cohesion.

---

## 1. Album Spine (Non‑Negotiable)

### 1.1 One‑Sentence Purpose

> **Atalanta** is an instrumental rock concept album tracing a woman’s transformation from abandonment to freedom through exile, conflict, and transcendence.

Every track must support **transformation**. Tracks that do not clearly advance this arc should be merged, simplified, or removed.

---

### 1.2 Macro Narrative Structure (Acts)

The album is organized into four acts. This structure should not change once locked.

### 1.3 Global Constraints

- **Key Center:** Every track must be in **A Minor**.
- **Naming:** Every track title must start with the letter **A** (e.g., Artemis, Atalanta).

**Act I – Origin (Identity Without Choice)**  
Abandonment → Adoption → Protection

**Act II – Formation (Strength With Constraints)**  
Arcadia → Training → Purpose

**Act III – Rupture (Conflict & Loss)**  
Adventure → War → Exile

**Act IV – Release (Freedom Through Loss)**  
Artifice → Transformation → Eternal Motion

## 2. Track Mapping by Act

### Act I – Origin

1. **Abandoned**  
   - Narrative role: Exposure, vulnerability, survival
   - Musical constraint: sparse, unresolved, restrained dynamics

2. **Artemis**  
   - Narrative role: Protection, authority, divine shaping
   - Musical constraint: introduces the **primary melodic motif** of the album

> The motif introduced here should recur later in altered forms.

---

### Act II – Formation

3. **Arcadia**  
   - Narrative role: Stability, safety, routine
   - Musical constraint: predictable harmony, loop‑friendly structure

4. **Adventure**  
   - Narrative role: Departure from safety, forward momentum
   - Musical constraint: longer phrases, modulation, reduced repetition

> These tracks must sound clearly different in intent. If not, merge or cut one.

---

### Act III – Rupture

5. **Attack**  
   - Narrative role: Chaos, confusion, external conflict
   - Musical constraint: rhythmic density, aggression, instability

6. **Abandoned II – Exiled** *(formerly “Abandoned (again)”)*  
   - Narrative role: Loss of identity, rejection by Arcadia
   - Musical constraint: thematic symmetry with **Abandoned I**

**Symmetry Rules:**
- Shared key center or melodic motif
- Increased tempo, distortion, and rhythmic weight

---

### Act IV – Release

7. **Artifice**  
   - Narrative role: The race, illusion of choice, temptation
   - Musical constraint: bright energy with subtle instability
   - Techniques: odd phrase lengths, sudden stops, deceptive major tonality

8. **Atalanta**  
   - Narrative role: Acceptance, eternal motion, freedom through loss
   - Reframed mood: calm, accepting, relentless
   - Musical constraint: forward motion without triumph

---

## 3. Track‑Level Execution Constraints

### 3.1 Fixed Track Template

Each track is limited to:

- 1 primary riff
- 1 secondary motif
- 1 texture change
- 1 emotional turn

Anything beyond this indicates either over‑writing or the need to split the track.

---

### 3.2 Instrument Role Locking

To reduce tone‑chasing and arrangement paralysis:

- **Clean guitar** → memory, innocence
- **Distorted guitar** → conflict, will
- **Rhythm gyitar** → motion, grounding
- **Bass** → inevitability, grounding force
- **Drums** → environment and motion, not virtuosity

Roles should only be violated for explicit narrative reasons.

---

## 4. Naming & Consistency Rules

To eliminate low‑level friction:

- Album title: **Atalanta** (consistent spelling)
- Track names: consistent capitalization
- Mood descriptors: maximum **three adjectives per track**
- Groove: one descriptor per track

**Example:**

**Abandoned**  
- Mood: sorrowful, fragile, hopeful  
- Groove: emotional ballad

---

## 5. Writing Order (Critical)

Do **not** write tracks sequentially.

Recommended order:

1. **Artemis** (establishes main motif)
2. **Atalanta** (final resolution)
3. **Abandoned I – Exposed**
4. **Abandoned II – Exiled**
5. Remaining tracks

This minimizes rework and ensures thematic cohesion early.

---

## 6. Definition of “Done”

A track is considered **done** when:

- Structure is fixed
- Motifs are final
- The arrangement plays start‑to‑finish without stopping

Tone shaping, mixing, and ornamentation come later.

---

## 7. Operating Principle

Progress on *Atalanta* comes from **reducing degrees of freedom**, not increasing inspiration.

Constraints protect momentum.
